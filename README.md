# JavaScript Learning Notes üìö

My comprehensive notes and examples while learning JavaScript fundamentals.

## üìñ What's Inside

- **[Complete JavaScript Notes](javascript-fundamentals.md)** - Full detailed notes with examples
- Variables, data types, and scope
- Mathematical operations and operators
- String manipulation and methods
- Array operations and methods
- Functions and their usage
- Practical examples and exercises

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Start with the [main notes file](javascript-fundamentals.md)
2. Each concept includes explanation + example
3. Use Ctrl+F to search for specific topics
4. Practice with the code examples in your browser console

## üìö Topics Covered

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Variables | `var`, `let`, `const` and scope |
| Data Types | strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, etc. |
| Operators | arithmetic, assignment, comparison |
| Strings | methods, concatenation, escaping |
| Arrays | manipulation, methods, multidimensional |
| Functions | creation, parameters, scope |

## üí° How I Learn

- Write detailed notes with examples
- Practice each concept immediately
- Build small projects to reinforce learning
- Document everything for future reference
